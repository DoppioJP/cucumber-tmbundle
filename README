Textmate Bundle for Cucumber

This is a fork of the rspec-story-tm-bundle (http://github.com/bmabey/rspec-story-tmbundle).
The goal is to keep the same functionality that the original bundle had but make it compatible with Cucumber and also take advantage of the benefits that Cucumber offers.

Features:
  * Color highlighting for plain text features
    * Themes that have been modified to take advantage of this can be found in color_themes/
    * Snippets for plain text features and step files.  Include feature keywords plus webrat snippets.
  * Predefined completions (escape key) for common feature keywords.
  * Spellchecking turned on by default for the plain text features.
  * PENDING Run the current plain text feature and display in HTML.  Clickable backtrace and all.
  * Switch between plain text feature and corresponding step matcher file.
  * Automatically create template step file with pending steps based on the steps used in the feature.
  
  

Caveats:
  * The running of features and file switching relies on the following directory structure convention:
     Basic features (no sub-directories):
     
       /project_root/features
   		   |- basic_feature.feature (extension must be .feature)
   		   |- steps
   		       |- basic_feature_steps.rb
   		       |- env.rb
     
     Using feature sub-directories:
     
       /project_root/features
  		   |- feature_one
  		   |   |- some_feature.feature
  		   |   |- steps
  		   |       |- some_feature_steps.rb
  		   |
  		   |- feature_two
  		   | .....
  	
  	These directory structures can be used together (basic features can reside in the root features directory, and feature sets can be put in sub directories).
