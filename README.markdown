Things Specific to this Fork
============================

Running Specs
-------------

This project relies on rvm and bundler for doing development. Its suggested you use the .rvmrc.sample file to set a project environment then

1. install bundler
1. run bundle install

Now you should be able to run both

1. `rake spec`
1. `spec support/spec`
